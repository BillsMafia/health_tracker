# Health Tracker

Main dashboard gives links to show a list of:
* Calories Consumed
* Exercises Performed
* Steps Taken
* Weights Entered

Once on the page, the user can enter in information for the corresponding category. 

The Dashboard also gives calculations for net number of calories for the day, number of miles walked today, and weight loss/gain from the previous day.
